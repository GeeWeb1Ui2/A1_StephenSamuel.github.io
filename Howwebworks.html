    <h3 style="text-align: left;">How the web works</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
            This should help you understand what's happening in the background of a website.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Clients & Servers</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">
        Computers with internet are called clients/servers. They interact as shown in the below diagram:<br>
        Cients are:
        <br>1. Internet-connected devices (For example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi) 
        <br>2. Web-accessing software available on those devices (Web browsers like Chrome).
        <br>Servers are:
        <br>1. Computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. 
        When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server and displayed in the 
        web browser.
            </p style="text-align: left;">
    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Components that make web</h3>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The client and server don't describe the whole story. Let find out all about it in detail. 
            <br>The web is a road. The client is on one end and the server on the other. To reach the other end you have to say hello to:<br>
    <br>1. Internet connection:<br>
    Allows you to send and receive data on the web.<br>
    <br>2. TCP/IP:<br>
    Communication protocols that define how data should travel across the net. <br>
    <br>3. DNS:<br>
    DNS is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser finds the website's IP address and retrieves the website.<br>
    <br>4. HTTP:<br>
    An application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. 
    <br><br>5. Component files:<br>
    A website is made up of many different files. These files come in two main types:<br>
    Code files are websites that are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
             (a) Assets: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.<br>           
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">So what happens, exactly?</div> 
        
<center><p style="text-align: left;">  When you type a web address into your browser:<br><br>
            The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on. <br><br>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client. <br><br>This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.<br><br>
             If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "OK" message, <br>and sends the website's files to the browser as a series of small chunks called data packets. <br><br>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you.</center>
    <center><p style="text-align: left;">Earlier we used the term "packets" to describe the format in which the data is sent from server to client.<br><br> Basically, when data is sent across the web, it is sent in thousands of small chunks. <br><br>There are multiple reasons why data is sent in small packets. They are sometimes dropped or corrupted, <br>and it's easier to replace small chunks when this happens. <br><br>Additionally, this can make the exchange faster and allow many different users to download the same website at the same time. <br>If each website was sent as a single big chunk, only one user could download it at a time.</center>
